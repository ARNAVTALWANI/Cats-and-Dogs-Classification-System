# Cats-and-Dogs-Classification-System

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify input images of animals as either "cats" or "dogs" using two convolutional layers and the ReLU activation function. The model achieves an average of 80% accuracy over the dataset across training, validation, and testing, and performs superiorly in almost every respect to a similarly designed Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is also provided in the notebook file in this repository.
